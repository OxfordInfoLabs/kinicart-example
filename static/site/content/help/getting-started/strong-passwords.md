Netistrar follows the advice of [HM Government UK](https://www.cyberaware.gov.uk/passwords) we recommend strong passwords to deter cyber attacks and criminals gaining to your accounts.

The effect of a cyber attack on a domain name management account, such as your account with Netistrar, could seriously impact your business or operations.  Please follow the guidance about how to generate a strong password, the qualities of a strong password, and password security in general.

#### 2-Factor authentication
For additional security, we also recommend that you enable 2-Factor authentication on your Netistrar account.  Please follow [these instructions to set up 2-Factor authentication on your account](/help/getting-started/2-factor-authentication/ ).
