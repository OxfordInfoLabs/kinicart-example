Netistrar is committed to providing excellent customer service.  

You can contact us by [email or phone](/help/contact/contact-details/) during normal office hours.  The best approach is to email us, so that we can all keep track of your issue.  We aim to provide an acknowledgement of customer communications on the next business day, and to resolve your issue as soon as practicable (normally, within a few working days).

We aim to provide excellent standards of communication and customer service.  However, if you have a complaint about the quality of our service, please refer to [our complaints policy](/terms/policies/netistrar-complaints-policy/).
