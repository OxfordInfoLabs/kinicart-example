#### What are glue records?
Glue records are essentially DNS records that resolve circular dependendies - where a nameserver is also a subdomain of it's own parent domain name (e.g. ns1.netistrar.com is a subdomain of netistrar.com).  See this more [in-depth help article](/help/domain-names/glue-records/) about understanding glue records and how to set up glue records where you need them.

<h4 id="ukreserved">What is a .UK reserved domain name?</h4>
                                                           
At 08:00hrs on 10 June 2014 the .UK manager Nominet launched the domain name .uk into the UK domain family. [Following their advice](https://www.theukdomain.uk/do-i-have-uk-rights/), if you are an existing customer and own a unique .co.uk, .org.uk, .me.uk, .net.uk, .plc.uk or .ltd.uk, a .uk domain name may already have been reserved especially for you until 25 June 2019.

Netistrar enables you to register .UK domain names if you are the rights holder for a matching domain name.  Essentially, if you already own something.co.uk (and did so so prior to 10 June 2014) you will probably qualify as a rights holder for the .uk domain name.
