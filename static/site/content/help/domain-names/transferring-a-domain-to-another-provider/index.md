## Transfers to another provider ##

To transfer your domain name to another provider you will need to complete the following instructions which are different for 
UK and non-UK domains.



## For UK domains

Before starting you will need to ensure that you have obtained the __Nominet TAG__ for your new provider.  This will often be 
available from within the providers control panel or provided to you via email on request.


1. Navigate to the domain within the Netistrar dashboard and click on the Transfers sub menu item on the left hand side.  You should be presented with the following
screen.

2. Select the __Transfer to another provider__ option from the picker on the top right.


3. Enter the Nominet TAG obtained from your new supplier and click __Start Transfer__.

4. As a security check we will send an email to the registered owner for the domain with links allowing them to accept / reject the transfer.  Once they have 
confirmed this, the transfer will be completed immediately.  

5. Once the transfer has been completed you will be notified via email and the domain will cease to be available within your account.



## For Non-UK domains


1. Navigate to the domain within the Netistrar dashboard and follow [these instructions to unlock your domain name](../domain-security/).  
_Please Note:  It may not always be possible to unlock your domain for transfer in accordance with ICANN rules.  For example, domain names
must be locked for 60 days following a transfer in to Netistrar or change of the registered owner._ 

2. Once unlocked you should see the Authorisation code at the bottom of the Domain Security screen as shown below:

3. Log into your new providers control panel and follow their instructions for transferring a NON-UK domain into their system.  You will 
be prompted for an Auth Code (sometimes called a domain password) as part of this process.

4. Once the transfer has been started, as a security check we will send an email to the registered owner for the domain with links allowing them to accept / reject the transfer.  If no response 
is received the transfer will complete after 5 days of being started.  

5. Once the transfer has been completed you will be notified via email and the domain will cease to be available within your account.
