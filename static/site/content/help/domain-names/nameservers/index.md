    From Dashboard > Domains > YOURDOMAIN.COM > Nameservers
    
In this section, you can select Nameserver options for your domain name.

Nameservers are the key routing servers for domain name traffic, ie. your Nameservers provide DNS services for website and email traffic.

Netistrar provides two options for setting Nameservers: 

#### 1. Use your own namerservers
Ideal for expert users.  Select this option if you intend to use your own Nameservers (or third party Nameservers) to resolve internet traffic.
Please refer to your Nameserver provider for the Nameserver address details to enter here. _Note: if you select this option, you will no longer have access to your DNS records in the [DNS settings section](/help/domain-names/dns/) of this dashboard.  DNS records will then be maintained outside the Netistrar system._

#### 2. Use Netistrar's Nameservers
Ideal for users who don't want the hassle of configuring their own Nameservers, and have simple requirements, ie. a website and an email provider.  There is no additional cost for this service subject to our [terms and conditions](/terms/).

_Note: This will enable your [DNS settings](/help/domain-names/dns/)_.
